# Project Class: META-CHIIDS Control Plane

Welcome to the control plane for META-CHIIDS. This directory contains **authoritative materials** that define how the meta-project operates.

The `project/` directory follows the **Repository Authority Model** — ensuring clarity about what's canonical, what's published, and what's in-progress. For the full authority model, see **[AUTHORITY-MODEL.md](AUTHORITY-MODEL.md)**.

## CHIIDS Meta-Project Overview

**CHIIDS (CHI Integrated Digital System)** is a meta-project that defines the structural framework for organizing all CHI research. It is self-referential: both the framework-maker and a meta-project following its own structure.

**Purpose:**
- **Structural Framework:** Database schema, ontology, and architectural principles
- **Integration Infrastructure:** APIs, workflows, and platform connections
- **Coordination System:** The "digital nervous system" connecting meta-projects, coordination, and execution

**Status:** Bootstrap (P0 - Critical Path)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for development priorities and milestones.
