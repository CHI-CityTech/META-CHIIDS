# project/_scratch

**⚠️ NON-AUTHORITATIVE**

This folder contains drafts, experiments, and AI-collaboration artifacts that are **not** treated as official policy or deliverables. Materials here are retained for reference and discussion but should not be used as controlling inputs for ingestion systems or architecture decisions.

## What Goes Here

- Rough drafts and brainstorms
- AI-generated briefings and discussion documents
- Temporary analysis and exploration notes
- Experiment results and POC artifacts
- Any file explicitly tagged as "for AI discussion"

## What Does NOT Go Here

- Operational rules (→ parent `project/` directory)
- Human-facing deliverables (→ `docs/` directory)
- Finalized templates or contracts (→ `project/` directory)

## Promotion Rules

When a `_scratch/` document becomes important:

1. **To `project/`** if it defines workflows, rules, schemas, or operational controls
2. **To `docs/`** if it becomes a deliverable intended for readers
3. **Archived/deleted** if it loses relevance

When promoting, add a one-line note in the destination file:
```
Promoted from `project/_scratch/` after review.
```
