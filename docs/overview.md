# CHI Integrated Digital System (CHIIDS) — Abstract

The CHI Integrated Digital System (CHIIDS) is a modular framework designed to support the Center for Holistic Integration's interdisciplinary projects by emphasizing integration over duplication. CHIIDS provides a lightweight, interoperable architecture that connects project management, communications, storage, and external systems into a cohesive digital ecosystem. The design prioritizes scalability, user accessibility, data security, and adaptability to different collaboration models. Key functions include task and milestone tracking, real-time and asynchronous communication channels, centralized document and media storage with versioning and archiving, and API-driven integration points to leverage established external tools.

This document summarizes CHIIDS' guiding principles, core components, data types, and tentative subsystems, and includes a visual system map (CHIIDS V1) that illustrates component relationships and data flows. CHIIDS aims to reduce redundancy by orchestrating existing platforms and tools, enabling CHI to focus resources on research, creative development, and essential innovations.
