# CHIIDS: CHI Integrated Digital System

<img src="assets/ChatGPT_CHIIDS_Logo.png" alt="CHIIDS Logo" width="100" align="right" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;"/>

The digital nervous system for the Center for Holistic Integration (CHI) and the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework.

CHIIDS is a distributed, three-layer digital ecosystem designed to support the entire lifecycle of CHI's meta-projects: from theoretical proposal through active research to long-term archival.

**[Original Proposal v1.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0aqvqdeZxtAF902jXT1ZbHkHBc3ir7pMu6n1M7OTQ4/edit?usp=sharing)** | **[Abstract](ABSTRACT.md)** | **[Getting Started](#getting-started)**

## What is CHIIDS?

CHIIDS integrates research coordination, project management, collaborative AI workflows, and knowledge archiving across all CHI initiatives (BBS, BRPS, BSP, CAI, UNESCO World-Building, and more).

**Core Philosophy:** Integration over Creation — orchestrate existing systems rather than build redundant tools.

The system is built on three interacting layers:

1. **Meta-Project Layer** — Permanent project proposals, ontology, and dependencies
2. **Research Coordination** — Semester-updated student assignments and project tracking  
3. **Execution** — Individual team repositories where actual work happens

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for the full three-layer system description.

## Key Principles

CHIIDS is guided by CHI's core philosophy of _Holistic Integration_ and the _Balanced Blended Space (BBS)_ framework:

- **Scalability**: Accommodate growing participants, projects, and datasets
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing platforms; no redundant systems
- **User-Friendliness**: Accessible across academic and professional disciplines
- **Data Security & Privacy**: Strong protocols for integrity and confidentiality
- **Adaptability**: Flexible to support multiple interaction models
- **Task Automation**: Routine processes increase efficiency
- **Integration over Creation**: Orchestrate existing tools; focus on innovation

## Getting Started

### For Faculty/PIs
1. Read **[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — understand the three-layer system
2. Use **[PROJECT_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md](templates/PROJECT_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md)** to propose new projects
3. Store proposals in `/database/proposals/[project_name]/`
4. Update SQLite metadata with project information

### For Student Researchers
1. Find your project in **[StudentResearch](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/StudentResearch)**
2. Read your semester's Project Card for goals and milestones
3. Work in your **team's dedicated repository** (not in StudentResearch)
4. Update GitHub issues and milestones to track progress
5. Document AI usage in your team repo README

### For StudentResearch Managers
1. Review **[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for the coordination layer role
2. Use **[PROJECT_CARD_TEMPLATE.md](templates/PROJECT_CARD_TEMPLATE.md)** for each active project per semester
3. Link proposals from META-CHIIDS to team repositories
4. Maintain semester rosters and milestone tracking

### For System Integration
1. Read **[INTEGRATION-PATHS.md](docs/INTEGRATION-PATHS.md)** for GitHub, OpenLab, WorldAnvil, Zotero guidance
2. For world-building workflows, see **[WORLDANVIL-WORKFLOW.md](docs/WORLDANVIL-WORKFLOW.md)**

## Explore the Meta-Project Database

The CHIIDS ecosystem is stored in a SQLite database (`database/chiids.db`) with queryable projects, dependencies, and tags.

### Quick Start

**Web UI (Recommended):**
1. **🌐 Live Public Access:** [chiids-dcha87xgm-david-b-smiths-projects.vercel.app](https://chiids-dcha87xgm-david-b-smiths-projects.vercel.app) — explore, search, and export from anywhere
2. **Local Testing:** Run `python3 -m datasette database/chiids.db` → Open http://localhost:8001
3. **How to Use:** See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for search, filter, and export instructions

**CLI (no dependencies):**
```bash
python3 scripts/chiids_cli.py list-projects
python3 scripts/chiids_cli.py hierarchy
python3 scripts/chiids_cli.py dependencies --slug ai-integrated-performance
python3 scripts/chiids_cli.py project --slug blended-reality-performance-system
```

**VS Code GUI:**
1. Install the SQLite extension (alexcvzz)
2. `Cmd+Shift+P` → "SQLite: Open Database" → `database/chiids.db`
3. Browse tables in the Explorer sidebar

**Interactive SQL:**
```bash
sqlite3 database/chiids.db
```
See [database/INITIALIZATION.md](database/INITIALIZATION.md) for example queries.

### Cloud Deployment (Public Access)

✅ **Live now!** Your database is already deployed to Vercel at:
**[chiids-dcha87xgm-david-b-smiths-projects.vercel.app](https://chiids-dcha87xgm-david-b-smiths-projects.vercel.app)**

Anyone can now search, filter, and export CHIIDS project data from their browser—no installation needed.

**To redeploy after database updates:**
```bash
# After updating seed_data.sql locally:
rm database/chiids.db
sqlite3 database/chiids.db < database/schema.sql < database/seed_data.sql

# Redeploy:
python3 -m datasette publish vercel database/chiids.db --project chiids
```

See [DATASETTE.md](DATASETTE.md) for detailed deployment instructions.
