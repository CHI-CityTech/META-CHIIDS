## CHI Integrated Digital System (CHIIDS) - Summary

The CHI Integrated Digital System (CHIIDS) is a modular digital framework developed to support the collaborative mission of the Center for Holistic Integration (CHI). It enhances interdisciplinary projects, maintains project integrity, and ensures efficient use of existing tools while integrating seamlessly with external systems. A guiding philosophy of CHIIDS is **Integration over Creation**—instead of building redundant tools, CHIIDS integrates existing systems into the larger ecosystem, allowing CHI to focus on innovation and essential project goals.

## Guiding Principles and Considerations
CHIIDS is guided by CHI's core philosophy of _Holistic Integration_ and the _Balanced Blended Space (BBS)_ framework, which emphasizes the seamless interaction between virtual and physical spaces as well as the balance between cognitive and computational processes. Key design principles include:

- **Scalability**: The ability to accommodate a growing number of participants, projects, and datasets.
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing internal and external platforms, ensuring that no redundant systems are created.
- **User-Friendliness**: An intuitive interface ensuring accessibility across various academic and professional disciplines.
- **Data Security and Privacy**: Strong protocols to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Adaptability**: Flexible to support multiple interaction models like BBS without major structural changes.
- **Task Automation**: Automation of routine processes to increase project efficiency and productivity.
- **Integration over Creation**: Instead of duplicating existing tools or creating redundant systems, CHIIDS focuses on integrating proven external platforms into its operations, allowing resources to be directed toward more critical and innovative areas.

## Core Components
CHIIDS is structured around four essential components:

1. **Project Management**: Facilitates task assignments, progress tracking, resource allocation, and milestone management across projects, reducing redundancy and improving overall management efficiency.  
    - 1.1 Project 1  
    - 1.2 Project 2  
    - 1.n Project n  

2. **Communications**: Provides real-time collaboration tools for internal teams and external partners, supporting public engagement and ensuring information flows seamlessly between all stakeholders.
     - 2.1 Internal Communcation
       - 2.1.1 Project Communication
       - 2.1.2 Extra-CHI Communication
       - 2.1.3 Meta-Project Communication
     - 2.2 External Communication
       - 2.2.1 Public Web site
       - 2.2.2 Social Media
       - 2.2.3 Research Opportunities 

3. **Storage**: Centralized and secure organization of project documents, media, and deliverables, with efficient version control and archival functionality, ensuring all data is well-managed and easily accessible.  
     - 3.1 Documentation Repositories
       - 3.1.1 Project Documentation
       - 3.1.2 Version Control
       - 3.1.3 Meta-Project Assessment
     - 3.2 Archiving  
       - 3.2.1 Project Archives
       - 3.2.2 Administrative Archives
       - 3.2.3 Living Archive
     - 3.3 Dynamic Virtual Environments  
       - 3.3.1 Virtual Worlds
       - 3.3.2 World Canons/wikis
       - 3.3.3 Research Databases
       - 3.3.4 LLM datasets
        
4. **Integration with External Systems**: Recognizing the collaborative nature of CHI's mission, this component enables CHIIDS to connect with external tools and platforms via APIs, ensuring smooth interaction with different systems and preserving project integrity without reinventing or duplicating capabilities.
    - 4.1 External System 1
    - 4.2 External System 2
    - 4.n External System n

## System Components and Data Types
CHIIDS manages a variety of data, including:

- **Project Management Data**: Tracks tasks, resources, and progress within and across projects.
- **Documentation and Reports**: Centralized storage for project documents, including deliverables.
- **Version Control Data**: Supports technical development and collaboration, particularly for software and creative projects.
- **Media Data**: Manages multimedia outputs and project-related media.
- **Archival Data**: Preserves historical project data and outcomes for future reference.
- **Communication Logs**: Tracks both internal and external communications for continuity across projects.
- **Virtual Environments**: Maintains datasets for CHI-sponsored virtual environments/worlds/games  

## Tentative Subsystems
In keeping with the principle of **Integration over Creation**, CHIIDS integrates existing systems to ensure smooth functionality across all project activities:

- **Task and Project Management**: Tools like Microsoft Teams or Asana for tracking milestones, managing resources, and team roles.
- **Document Storage and Backup**: Integrated with systems like SharePoint, Google Drive, or OneDrive to store active and archival project data.
- **Version Control**: Platforms like GitHub for managing code, media, and collaborative documentation.
- **Public Engagement**: Tools like WordPress or OpenLab for external visibility and community interaction.

## Data Management Policies
CHIIDS ensures data integrity and security through robust management practices:

- **Access Control**: Permissions are managed based on roles, ensuring that sensitive data is protected and accessible only by authorized personnel.
- **Version Control**: Platforms like GitHub or SharePoint ensure efficient tracking of changes to files and documents.
- **Archival Protocols**: Clear processes for archiving and adding metadata to facilitate future retrieval.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Systems like OneDrive manage automated backups to safeguard against data loss.

## Integration with External Platforms
Aligned with the **Integration over Creation** philosophy, CHIIDS connects with external systems through API-driven integration. This allows CHI to build upon existing tools and platforms, such as GitHub for repositories, or WorldAnvil for world-building, to enhance CHI projects without duplicating functionality already maintained by other entities.

In summary, CHIIDS is a robust, scalable system that supports collaboration, storage, communication, and integration, emphasizing CHI’s commitment to **Integration over Creation**—leveraging existing systems to focus on the essential, creative, and innovative aspects of CHI’s research and project goals.
